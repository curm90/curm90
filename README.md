👋 Hi there! I'm Liam Sutton, a passionate software engineer with a focus on web development and a keen interest in web3, machine learning, and AI.

💻 As a software engineer, I am experienced in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js, leveraging these technologies to create innovative and user-friendly web applications. I strive to write clean, maintainable code while following industry best practices.

🎓 I graduated from a 12-month online bootcamp called Lambda School, now BloomTech Institution of Technology, where I honed my technical skills and gained practical experience in various software engineering disciplines. This rigorous program allowed me to work on real-world projects and collaborate with talented individuals, fostering my growth as a developer.

🌐 Beyond traditional web development, I am particularly fascinated by the potential of web3 technologies to reshape the internet and bring decentralization to various domains. Additionally, I have a strong curiosity for the fields of machine learning and AI, continuously exploring new advancements and applying them to solve complex problems.

📚 When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in books, indulging in a diverse range of subjects. I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to expand my knowledge in various domains. I'm also passionate about biohacking, exploring ways to optimize health and well-being. In my spare time, I enjoy exercising to stay active and find solace in cooking delicious meals.
